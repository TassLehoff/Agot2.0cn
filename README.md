[system history]

1. System will judge whether an attachment is valid on targeted card or not. Attachments will automatically add STR bonus and icons on attached cards.

2. Dupes and attachments will stick to orderly targeted cards when player move targeted cards.

3. Former carddlg cannot deal with non-unique same copies, so I add a selectmode to players in which they can choose cards on board or in hand, with double click and click next to finish the window

4. I’m now working on automatic process, these are what I have accomplished:
- Target selecting after initiate stealth
- Unopposed reward in 4.2.3
- Applying all claim effect in 4.2.4 automatically, including int, pow and mil(choose which character to kill->save interrupts->cancel interrupts->judging whether a character is saved successfully->leave play interrupts->leave play reactions)
Now I’m  working on reactions for determining the winner in 4.2.2, which I found very complicated and leads to very slow progress.
